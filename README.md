# repeat_reunion
Matlab code for the repeat reunion study

The code is organized in a collection of Matlab scripts and livescripts
All main sections are titled repeatreunion_part<X>_livescript.mlx (or repeatreunion_part<X>_script.m if a script).
To run, start with **_part0_**, which sets-up the variables, and then use the part that applies to the analysis you want to perform
 
 Index of parts:
 
 part 0: loading and organizing tables/variables
 part 1: analysis of female physical behavior, stranger/cagemate across days, using BORIS-scored data
 part 2: analysis of male physical behavior, stranger/cagemate across days, using BORIS-scored data
